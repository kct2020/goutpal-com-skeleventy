<h2 id="start">6️⃣ {{ title }}</h2>
<p>It takes time to reverse the build-up of crystals from years of excess uric acid. So we started safely with our chosen low dose uric acid cure in the previous phase. Now we continue to adjust that dose to reach safe uric acid levels. While continuing to monitor gout symptoms. And manage any adverse treatment effects.</p>
<h2 id="intro">{{ title }} Introduction</h2>
<p>There are too many topics about {{ topic }} for a single article. So this is a hub page for {{ topic }} articles. Which you can browse to find the specific topics that concern you most. However, it might not include all uric acid cure adjustment articles that are relevant to you. So you should also use the <a href="{{ site.searchurl }}">{{ site.searchname }}</a> to find more articles about {{ topic }}.</p>
<h2 id="progress">{{ title }} Progression</h2>
<p><em>{{ title }}</em> is the sixth phase of gout progression. During which we repeat a cycle of uric acid testing. Followed by adjusting the treatment dose that we started at a low level in the previous phase. Importantly, you must continue your gout symptoms journal. Because this helps to identify any bad effects of your treatment. But it also gives you confidence as you realize good effects.</p>
<p>This phase will continue until you reach your target uric acid level. Which is commonly set at below 6 mg/dL (0.36 mmol/L). But some rheumatologists recommend aiming below 5 mg/dL (0.30 mmol/L).</p>
<p>Medically, this is often referred to as the titration phase. Note that the medical definition differs from the chemistry definition, being:</p>
<p><q cite="https://www.optimusmedica.com/definition/titration-medication/">Titration is tweaking the dose of medication to find an optimal balance between benefits and side effects.<br> [Optimus Medica]</q></p>
<p>So, your medicine dose is titrated according to blood test results and your gout symptoms journal. </p>
<p>Occasionally, it is called the debulking phase. Because the aim is to dissolve the bulk of uric acid crystals that have built up over many years. So you should be aware that partial dissolving of crystals might cause gout flares until the debulking process is complete. Which is why rheumatologists recommend continuing pain control during this phase. Either as a daily preventative. Or as required by you when you first notice a gout flare.</p>
<p>Remember that standards for the titration phase have been developed with allopurinol or other medicines in mind. But these standards also apply to non-pharmaceutical processes. For example, you might be working with a dietitian to improve uric acid by changing your eating patterns. So if you are switching to a Mediterranean style dietary pattern, you might start with one day per week. Then titrate to two days, three days, etc.</p>
