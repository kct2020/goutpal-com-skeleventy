<p>Are you asking, "Why me? What have I done to cause gout?"</p>
<p>Or are you the type of gout sufferer who thinks, "I don't care what caused my gout! I just want to stop it now."</p>
<p>As with all aspects of gout recovery, there is no right or wrong approach. But it is vital that you and your professional advisers agree how you will consider gout causes during your shared decision-making processes.</p>
<h2 id="intro">{{ title }} Introduction</h2>
<p>There are too many causes of gout for a single article. So this is a hub page for {{ topic }} articles. Which you can browse to find the specific causes that concern you most. However, it might not include every cause of gout that is relevant to you. So you should also use the <a href="{{ site.searchurl }}">{{ site.searchname }}</a> to check for more articles relevant to your specific concerns.</p>
<h2 id="progress">{{ title }} Progression</h2>
<p><em>{{ title }}</em> is the first phase of gout progression. But you probably won't start here. Because most people never think about what causes gout until they get a diagnosis. </p>
<p>However, it is good to understand how gout is caused before you start uric acid treatment. Because some causes of gout will affect how you treat it. But there is no need to be too concerned about this. As the standard treatment for uric acid, allopurinol, is effective for most people irrespective of the cause. So that is why it's important that you and your doctor align your views on gout causes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, by agreeing how much time and effort you both allocate to identify causes of your gout.</li>
<li>Subsequently, by addressing any shared decision-making issues revealed by relevant articles….</li>
</ul>

I fully believe this because when I pee on thiazide it is all salt and when I pee on furosemide, it is almost all water…their mechanics are very different. Alas, the diuretic switch was only made after several years on relatively high dose thiazide and AFTER gout began.</q> Read <a href="/gout-pal-forum/please-help-my-gout/getting-off-all-diuretics-and-gout-med/">lasix and gout</a>.</td>

<h2 id="summary">{{ title }} Summary</h2>
<p>For convenience, while learning about {{ topic }}, we might identify different types. But what matters most to you and your doctor is whether the cause is avoidable or not. Because that might affect your choice of uric acid treatment.</p>
<p>Now, in standard gout management, even that doesn't matter. Because allopurinol controls uric acid in most gout sufferers, irrespective of the cause. But if you will not start allopurinol during Phase 5. Or if it proves to be ineffective during Phase 6. You and your medical team must consider if alternatives to allopurinol are more suitable to the causes of your gout.</p>
<p>See if your doctor provides any resources to help you identify different gout causes. Then start a personal gout causes research project to see which apply to you.</p>

I'm working on templates that help you identify, understand, and limit (where possible) your gout causes. In the meantime, you can start by adding notes about what you've learned about your gout causes so far.

All you do is highlight any text that interests you. Then click "Annotations" to personalize any GoutPal page. Which means you can keep your gout causes notes linked here, where you can always find them.
