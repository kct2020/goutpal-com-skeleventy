<p>Historically, uric acid testing has been fraught with problems for gout sufferers. Mainly because upper limits have been too vague to establish consistent treatment practices. But now it is clear that uric acid must be lowered below 6 mg/dL in most cases. So this phase of gout progression should be straightforward.</p>
<p>However, what about the cases that slip through the net? Does your doctor adhere to the latest standards? Would you prefer to see results that are better than standard uric acid testing and control?</p>
<p>It is time to ensure that you play your part in the shared decision-making processes for uric acid testing and results analysis.</p>
<h2 id="intro">{{ title }} Introduction</h2>
<p>There are too many {{ topic }} topics for a single article. So this is a hub page for {{ topic }} articles. Which you can browse to find the specific aspects of gout testing that concern you most. However, it might not include all {{ topic }} articles that are relevant to you. So you should also use the <a href="{{ site.searchurl }}">{{ site.searchname }}</a> to find more articles about your {{ topic }} concerns</a>.</p>
<h2 id="progress">{{ title }} Progression</h2>
<p><em>{{ title }}</em> is the fourth phase of gout progression. Being the phase that often confirms or identifies a diagnosis of gout. And sets baselines for forthcoming uric acid treatment.</p>
<p>As a gout patient, your involvement in this phase might be limited to supplying blood samples. Then listening to your doctor's decisions about treatment. But you should not accept such limitations. Because you need to be part of the shared decision processes. Not only about uric acid treatment.</p>
<p>As part of the uric acid test phase, you also need to be involved with decisions about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Urine tests for uric acid clearance</li>
<li>Liver function and kidney function tests</li>
<li>Joint fluid test for uric acid crystals</li>
<li>Imaging uric acid crystal tests including ultrasound, CAT, and MRI scans</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summary">{{ title }} Summary</h2>
<p>Early uric acid testing from doctors is typically limited to laboratory blood testing. Either to assist diagnosis, to establish a baseline prior to uric acid treatment, or both. Later, it is continued through titration and maintenance phases.</p>
<p>I'm not aware of any gout patient who would argue against this standard practice. But other aspects of uric acid testing are more contentious. As such, you must play your part in shared decision-making processes concerning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Additional uric acid clearance testing</li>
<li>Supporting lab tests with home uric acid test kits</li>
<li>Acceptable upper limit for uric acid levels in the blood</li>
<li>Joint fluid testing</li>
<li>Gout imaging</li>
</ul>
