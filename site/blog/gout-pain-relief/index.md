<h2 id="start">3️⃣ {{ title }}</h2>
<p>Gout pain causes misery. Even worse, it can distract you from uric acid control. Which you need to stop gout permanently. Worse still, very few medical professionals understand that one type of gout pain relief is rarely enough.</p>
<p>So now is the time to learn how to block inflammation. Then soothe it and deal with any residual pain. Then you can share in the decision-making processes about your gout pain relief package.</p>
<h2 id="intro">{{ title }} Introduction</h2>
<p>There are too many {{ topic }} topics for a single article. So this is a hub page for {{ topic }} articles. Which you can browse to find the specific topics that concern you most. However, it might not include all {{ topic }} articles that are relevant to you. So you should also use the <a href="{{ site.searchurl }}">{{ site.searchname }}</a> to find more articles about your {{ topic }} concerns</a>.</p>
<h2 id="progress">{{ title }} Progression</h2>
<p><em>{{ title }}</em> is the third phase of gout progression. Importantly, learning effective gout pain control helps you through the rest of your gout recovery. Because you face months of gout attacks until you finally get years of excess uric acid resolved.</p>
<p>But {{ topic }} is rarely straightforward. Because the pain pathways that are involved with gout are complex. So you usually need a care package that blocks inflammation spread, soothes existing inflammation, then relieves any residual pain.</p>
<p>The only way to get fast, effective gout pain control that works for you is to share the decisions about gout pain medications with your doctor and/or pharmacist. Because most gout attacks are too severe for over the counter remedies.</p>

<h2 id="summary">{{ title }} Summary</h2>
<p>You have to get advice about specific gout pain medications from doctors and pharmacists. Because your medical history and comorbidities affect your options. But you must play your part in the discussions. By asking about your choices for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Block new inflammation from uric acid crystals</li>
<li>Soothe existing painful swelling with anti-inflammatories</li>
<li>Relieve any residual pain</li>
</ol>
<p>You might not need all three for every gout attack. But you must learn to recognize when you do need them. Helped, of course, by your gout symptoms journal from Phase 2.</p>
