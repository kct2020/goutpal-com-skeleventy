<p>Gout symptoms can be surprising. Because they spread beyond toes. To all joints. Then into soft tissues affecting all your organs. Also, with redness, itching, tingling, numbness, and fever. You'll be amazed to see the variety of gout symptoms.</p>
<h2 id="intro">{{ title }} Introduction</h2>
<p>There are too many symptoms of gout for a single article. So this is a hub page for gout symptoms articles. Which you can browse to find the specific symptoms that concern you most. However, it might not include all {{ topic }} articles that are relevant to you. So you should also use the <a href="{{ site.searchurl }}">{{ site.searchname }}</a> to check for more articles relevant to your particular symptoms.</p>
<h2 id="progress">{{ title }} Progression</h2>
<p><em>{{ title }}</em> is the second phase of gout progression. Though you might not realize you have gout at first. Because many people believe that gout always involves a red, swollen, painful big toe.</p>
<p>But it is important that both you and your doctor are aware of all your gout symptoms. As they can influence your diagnosis and some of your subsequent treatment decisions. Also, it is good to get into the habit of recording your symptoms each day. Because that helps you and your doctor measure progress (or lack of it) towards gout recovery.</p>
